Proceed to STEP 1.

Objective:
Establish a solid, non-negotiable foundation for the platform UI and architecture.
This step is ONLY about project bootstrap and theming.
Do NOT add business logic.
Do NOT add booking logic.
Do NOT add database logic beyond setup validation.

Requirements (must follow exactly):

1. Framework & Structure
- Use Next.js App Router with TypeScript.
- Use React via Next.js only.
- Ensure the app runs without errors.

2. Project Structure
Create and confirm the following folders:
- /app
- /app/(public)
- /app/(auth)
- /app/(account)
- /app/(admin)
- /components
- /components/ui
- /lib
- /server
- /styles
- /storage

Do NOT place logic randomly outside this structure.

3. Tailwind & Theme System
- Tailwind CSS must be configured correctly.
- Implement a global theme system with:
  - Dark mode
  - Light mode
- Dark mode must be the default.
- Theme switching must persist across refresh.

4. Design Tokens (Glassmorphism)
Define Tailwind theme tokens for:
- Background (dark and light)
- Glass surfaces (with backdrop blur)
- Borders (subtle, semi-transparent)
- Shadows (soft, premium)
- Accent color (used sparingly)

Glassmorphism rules:
- Use backdrop-filter blur.
- No harsh borders.
- No heavy gradients.
- Premium, restrained aesthetic.

5. Base UI Components
Create the following reusable components inside /components/ui:
- GlassCard
- Button (variants: primary, secondary, ghost)
- Input
- Select
- Modal
- Badge

Each component must:
- Support dark and light mode
- Be responsive
- Be accessible (basic focus states)

6. Animations
- Use Framer Motion.
- Add subtle animations:
  - Page enter/exit
  - Hover micro-interactions on buttons and cards
- No excessive motion.

7. UI Showcase Page
Create a route:
- /ui

This page must display:
- All base components
- Both dark and light mode states
- Example layouts using GlassCard

This page is mandatory and will be used as the design reference for the rest of the platform.

8. Output Requirements (MANDATORY)
When finished, provide:
- Confirmation that the app runs successfully
- Folder tree
- List of created UI components
- Screenshot or description of /ui page

STOP after completing this step.
Do NOT proceed to database, booking, or payments.
Wait for explicit confirmation before moving to the next prompt.
